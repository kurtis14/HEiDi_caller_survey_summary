    "text": "HEiDi callers are emailed a link to the survey along with the information for their encounter. The survey is anonymous, optional, and completed online using HLBC’s survey platform.\nDate of first response received: 2020-06-04.\nDate of most recent response received: 2023-06-30.\nTotal responses received: 4148.\nNumber of questions in survey: 23.\nNote, the survey questions were updated in December 2020, so there are some inconsistencies between the current and old versions. 27.1% of responses are from the old version. The survey was also updated in March 2022.\n\n\nApproximately 130,000 HEiDi encounters have occurred over the same time period that the survey has been open. This reflects an estimated response rate of 3.2%. Given the extremely low response rate, all survey results should be interpreted cautiously."
