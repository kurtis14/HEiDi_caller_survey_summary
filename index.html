<h1>Survey Details/Notes</h1>
<p>HEiDi callers are emailed a link to the survey along with the information for their encounter. The survey is anonymous, optional, and completed online using HLBCâ€™s survey platform.</p>
<p>Date of first response received: 2020-06-04.<br>
Date of most recent response received: 2023-06-30.<br>
Total responses received: 4148.<br>
Number of questions in survey: 23.</p>
<p>Note, the survey questions were updated in December 2020, so there are some inconsistencies between the current and old versions. 27.1% of responses are from the old version. The survey was also updated in March 2022.</p>
<section id="caution-interpretation-limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caution-interpretation-limitations">CAUTION: Interpretation Limitations</h2>
<p>Approximately 130,000 HEiDi encounters have occurred over the same time period that the survey has been open. <strong>This reflects an estimated response rate of 3.2%.</strong> Given the extremely low response rate, all survey results should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
